## Inspiration

The concept for "Starman" was born from our passion for game development. Drawing from this, we aimed to create a game where players could intimately interact with a system of planets and gravity.

## What it does

"Starman" is a strategic puzzle game where players navigate a ship through space using the gravity of planets they place within the game area. The objective is to reach a defined goal, all while avoiding obstacles and utilizing the forces of gravity to your advantage. It's an experience where each level is a blank canvas for players to carve their path through space, offering a unique blend of creativity, strategy, and physics.

## How we built it

Utilizing Unity and C#, we developed "Starman". The process involved scripting the physics, designing and scripting intuitive UI, and developing levels that cater to both newcomers and experienced players. The heart of the game lies in its physics engine, which accurately represents gravitational forces and other features such as movement dampening and portal teleportation, providing an immersive experience.

## Challenges we ran into

During the development, we encountered challenges including accurately simulating gravity, optimizing the UI for a seamless drag-and-drop experience, implementing different features such as accurate portals, and fine-tuning the levels to offer a gradual increase in difficulty without stifling the player's creativity. Debugging and iteratively improving the product was a continuous process, helping us refine "Starman" to its current state.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of everything that we made, since it was all of our first time using the Unity game engine. The fact that we were able to create a complete game within the time span of about 15 hours using an engine and language that we learned for the first time is something that we are all proud of.

## What we learned

Through this journey, we learned the intricacies of game development â€” from concept to execution. The experience honed our skills in Unity, physics simulation, and UI design. Furthermore, we grasped a deeper understanding of the iterative process of game design, where constant feedback and adjustments are key to crafting a polished final product.

## What's next for Starman

Looking ahead, we envision expanding "Starman" with more levels and potentially introducing new elements like black holes or asteroids to add layers to the gameplay. We are also considering a mobile version.
